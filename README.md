At Forma.ai, I:
- build `React` dashboards
   - so sales reps know how much they get paid and why
- write `SQL` queries from business logic
- develop on a `Django` backend to send data to the frontend

I've taken the lead in building up our company's [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to boost dev productivity.

At IBM, I:
- built web components with `JS` and `LESS` to match IBM Carbon Design
- increased the team's productivity on top of my work with
   - `puppeteer` automation scripts
   - documentation and guidance on switching dev environments to `Linux`
      - for 6x build speeds
   - and a script that integrates with [RTC (IBM's version of git)](https://jazz.net/products/workflow-management/)
      - to avoid overriding someone else's changes

ðŸ’» &nbsp; I like building apps with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python and Postgres!
