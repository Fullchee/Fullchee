At Forma.ai, I'm building incentive compensation Dashboards and core components to help sales people understand how they're getting paid.

I've taken the lead in building up our company's [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to boost dev productivity.

At IBM, I've been building web components with JavaScript and LESS to match IBM Carbon Design. Software development is a team sport so on top of the expected work I've built a few internal command line tools to increase the team's productivity: two puppeteer automation scripts and a script that integrates with [RTC (IBM's version of git)](https://jazz.net/products/workflow-management/) to have formatted diffs.

ðŸ’» &nbsp; I like building apps with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python and Postgres!
