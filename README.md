At IBM, I've been building web components with JavaScript and LESS to match IBM Carbon Design. Software development is a team sport so on top of the expected work I've built a few internal command line tools to increase the team's productivity: two puppeteer automation scripts and a script that integrates with [RTC (IBM's version of git)](https://jazz.net/products/workflow-management/) to have formatted diffs.

I'm also really grateful to scratch my own itch. Recently, a family member got a high water bill from a leaky toilet so I built a web app that detectsÂ high water usage. When my sister worked at a supermarket and only got her schedule once every week, I built an app to create batch Google Calendar events under 30 seconds.

ðŸ’» I like to build apps with TypeScript, React, Node.js and Postgres
